- If a user_id exists in a table one, it should be labeled the same way else where

- Budget table, captures incoming money (Not really a Budget)
- Budget Table could be called Income? (Incoming Money)
- Budget Expenses this is what they're actually spending

- They need to align, whats consistent, building based off of traits in common
- Optimization of performance, bigger the table, more joins exist, performance issues when running the query
- SQL Server Management Studio - Power BI
