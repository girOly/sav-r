# Sav-r

## Description

Financial prudence, and keeping track of your spending, is critical for being able to succeed financially in life. You know this. The problem is that keeping track of spending is really tedious, and you hate doing it. You've tried tracking your spending in the past but have always given up after a few days. Inputing where you bought something, how much it cost, and what spending category it should be entered into is not how you like spending your time. Enter Sav-r.

Sav-r makes doing the things you already know you should do easy. Take a picture of your receipt, upload it, let Sav-r do the rest. Our powerful machine learning algorithms identify which store you made the purchase at, how much you spent, and puts that expense in the category of your choosing.

Track your monthly spending with easy to read graphs, giving you a visualization of your spending in seconds.
